A Spring boot application 

What does the technology stack look like ?

As this is a full stack development project, I developed the code for both front-end and backend. 
A considerable amount of work done on developing the front-end code using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Thymeleaf, 
bootstrap and etc. 
Thymeleaf is the latest Java template engine, which is supposed to replace previous JSP way 
(JSP is discontinued but is still being used out there) and it is the official template engine backed by Spring Framework,
though it's not the only one you can choose. The backend side  uses latest Spring technologies - Spring Boot, 
Spring Security, Spring Data and etc.  MySQL  was choosen as database. 
MySQL is powerful and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.
